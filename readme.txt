The data is separated by "====================================\n". 
Once separated, the first line contains the X coordinates, the second line contains the Y coordinates, and the third line contains the Z coordinates for each node of the graph.
The fourth line represents the initial nodes, while the fifth line represents the final nodes for all edges in the directed graph. 
The sixth line denotes the source nodes, and the seventh line indicates the sink nodes. 
In the eighth line, you can find the flow values corresponding to the source nodes, and the ninth line contains the flow values corresponding to the sink nodes. 
The tenth line provides the thicknesses associated with one unit of flow for each tray type. Additionally, the eleventh line specifies the maximum flow capacity for each tray type. 
Starting from the twelfth line, the weights of the edges in the directed graph for each tray type are provided.
